# Starting Point

You'll want to start with either the stock config.plist that OpenCore gives you, or with just a blank canvas. In the next examples, I'll show you how I set things up from scratch; if you start from somewhere else, you may have more things checked/set than I do - but you'll want to follow along with what I do.


# ACPI

**Add:** This is where you'll add SSDT patches for your system, these are most useful for laptops and OEM desktops but also common for [USB maps](https://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/334899-intel-framebuffer-patching-using-whatevergreen/?tab=comments#comment-2626271) and [disabling unsupported GPUs](https://github.com/khronokernel/How-to-disable-your-unsupported-GPU-for-MacOS)
**Block**: 

**Patch**: 

This section allows us to dynamically rename parts of the DSDT via OpenCore. Since we're not running a real mac, and macOS is pretty particular with how things are named, we can make non-destructive changes to keep things mac-friendly. We have three entries here:

* *change XHCI to XHC* - helps avoid a conflict with built-in USB injectors
* *change XHC1 to XHC* - helps avoid a conflict with built-in USB injectors
* *change SAT0 to SATA* - for potential SATA compatibility

**Quirk**: Settings for ACPI.

* FadtEnableReset: Enable reboot and shutdown on legacy hardware, not recommended unless needed
* NormalizeHeaders: Cleanup ACPI header fields, irrelevant in 10.14
* RebaseRegions: Attempt to heuristically relocate ACPI memory regions
* ResetHwSig: Needed for hardware that fail fail to maintain hardware signature across the reboots and cause issues with
waking from hibernation
* ResetLogoStatus: Workaround for systems running BGRT tables, most don't have to worry about this

# DeviceProperties

**Add**: Sets device properties from a map.

`PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x2,0x0)` -> `AAPL,ig-platform-id`

* 0x19120000 - this is used when the iGPU is used to drive a display
   * 00001219 when hex-swapped
* 0x19120001 - this is used when the iGPU is only used for compute tasks, and doesn't drive a display
   * 01001219 when hex-swapped


[here](https://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/334899-intel-framebuffer-patching-using-whatevergreen/?tab=comments#comment-2626271)

`PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1b,0x0)` -> `Layout-id`

* Applies AppleALC audio injection, you'll need to do your own research on which codec your motherboard has and match it with AppleALC's layout. [AppleALC Supported Codecs](https://github.com/acidanthera/AppleALC/wiki/Supported-codecs).

**Block**: Removes device properties from map

# Kernel

**Add**: Here's where you specify which kexts to load, order matters here so make sure Lilu.kext is always first! Other higher priority kexts come after Lilu such as, VirtualSMC, AppleALC, WhateverGreen, etc.

**Emulate**: Needed for spoofing unsupported CPUs like Pentiums and Celerons

* CpuidMask: When set to Zero, original CPU bit will be used
* CpuidData: The value for the CPU spoofing, don't forget to swap hex

**Block**: Blocks kexts from loading. Sometimes needed for disabling Apple's trackpad driver for some laptops.

**Patch**: Patches kexts (this is where you would add USB port limit patches and AMD CPU patches).

**Quirks**:

* AppleCpuPmCfgLock: NO (Only needed when CFG-Lock can't be disabled in BIOS)
* AppleXcpmCfgLock: NO (Only needed when CFG-Lock can't be disabled in BIOS)
* AppleXcpmExtraMsrs: NO (Disables multiple MSR access needed for unsupported CPUs like Pentiums and certain Xeons)
* CustomSMBIOSGuid: NO (Performs GUID patching for UpdateSMBIOSMode Custom mode. Usually relevant for Dell laptops)
* DisbaleIOMapper: NO (Needed to get around VT-D if unable to disable in BIOS, can interfere with Firmware so avoid when possible)
* ExternalDiskIcons: YES (External Icons Patch, for when internal drives are treated as external drives)
* LapicKernelPanic: NO (Disables kernel panic on AP core lapic interrupt)
* PanicNoKextDump: YES (Allows for reading kernel panics logs when kernel panics occurs)
* ThirdPartyTrim: NO (Enables TRIM, not needed for AHCI or NVMe SSDs)
* XhciPortLimit: YES (This is actually the 15 port limit patch, don't rely on it as it's not a guaranteed solution for fixing USB. Please create a [USB map](https://usb-map.gitbook.io/project/) when possible. Its a temporary solution for those who have yet to create a USB map)

# Misc

**Boot**: Settings for boot screen (leave as-is unless you know what you're doing).
* Timeout: 5 (This sets how long OpenCore will wait until it automatically boots from the default selection).
* ShowPicker: YES (
* UsePicker: YES (Uses OpenCore's default GUI, set to NO if you wish to use a different GUI)

**Debug**: Debug has special use cases, leave as-is unless you know what you're doing.
* DisableWatchDog: NO (May need to be set for yes if macOS is stalling on something while booting)

**Security**: Security is pretty self-explanatory.

* RequireSignature: NO (We won't be dealing vault.plist so we can ignore)
* RequireVault: NO (We won't be dealing vault.plist so we can ignore as well)
* ScanPolicy: 0 (This allow you to see all drives available, please refer to OpenCore's DOC for furthur info on setting up ScanPolicy)

**Tools** Used for running OC debugging tools like clearing NVRAM, we'll be ignoring this

# NVRAM

**Add**: 7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82 (System Integrity Protection bitmask)

* boot-args:
   * -v - this enables verbose mode, which shows all the behind-the-scenes text that scrolls by as you're booting instead of the Apple logo and progress bar.  It's invaluable to any Hackintosher, as it gives you an inside look at the boot process, and can help you identify issues, problem kexts, etc.
   * dart=0 - this is just an extra layer of protection against Vt-d issues.
debug=0x100 - this prevents a reboot on a kernel panic.  That way you can (hopefully) glean some useful info and follow the breadcrumbs to get past the issues.
   * keepsyms=1 - this is a companion setting to debug=0x100 that tells the OS to also print the symbols on a kernel panic.   That can give some more helpful insight as to what's causing the panic itself.
   * shikigva=40 - this flag is specific to the iGPU.  It enables a few Shiki settings that do the following (found here):
      * 8 - AddExecutableWhitelist - ensures that processes in the whitelist are patched.
      * 32 - ReplaceBoardID - replaces board-id used by AppleGVA by a different board-id.

* csr-active-config: <00000000> (Settings for SIP, recommeded to manully change this within Recovery partition with csrutil)

* nvda_drv:  <> (For enabling WebDrivers)

* prev-lang:kbd: <> (Needed for non-latin keyboards)

**Block**: Forcibly rewrites NVRAM variables, not needed for us as `sudo nvram` is prefered but useful for those edge cases

**LegacyEnable** Allows for NVRAM to be stored on nvram.plist 

**LegacySchema** Used for assigning nvram variable

# Platforminfo

**Automatic**: YES (Generates PlatformInfo based on Generic section instead of DataHub, NVRAM, and SMBIOS sections)

**Generic**:

* SpoofVendor: YES
* SystemUUID: Can be generated with MacSerial or use pervious from Clover's config.plist.
* MLB: Can be generated with MacSerial or use pervious from Clover's config.plist.
* ROM: <> (6 character MAC address, can be entirely random)
* SystemProductName: Can be generated with MacSerial or use pervious from Clover's config.plist.
* SystemSerialNumber: Can be generated with MacSerial or use pervious from Clover's config.plist.
`ROM must either be Apple ROM (dumped from a real Mac), or your NIC MAC address, or any random MAC address (could be just 6 random bytes)` - Vit9696

**DataHub**

**PlatformNVRAM**

**SMBIOS**

**UpdateDataHub**: YES (Update Data Hub fields)

**UpdateNVRAM**: YES (Update NVRAM fields)

**UpdateSMBIOS**: YES (Update SMBIOS fields)

**UpdateSMBIOSMode**: Create (Replace the tables with newly allocated EfiReservedMemoryType)

![PlatformInfo](https://i.imgur.com/dIKAlhj.png)

# UEFI

**ConnectDrivers**: YES (Forces .efi drivers, change to NO for faster boot times but cerain file system drivers may not load)

**Drivers**: Add your .efi drivers here.

**Protocols**:

* AppleBootPolicy: NO (Ensures APFS compatibility on VMs or legacy Macs)
* ConsoleControl: NO (Replaces Console Control protocol with a builtin version, needed for when firmware doesnâ€™t support text output mode)
* DataHub: NO (Reinstalls Data Hub)
* DeviceProperties: NO (Ensures full compatibility on VMs or legacy Macs)

**Quirks**:

* ExitBootServicesDelay: 0 (Switch to 5 if running ASUS Z87-Pro with FileVault2)
* IgnoreInvalidFlexRatio: NO (Fix for when MSR_FLEX_RATIO (0x194) can't be disabled in the BIOS, required for all pre-skylake based systems)
* IgnoreTextInGraphics: NO (Fix for UI corruption when both text and graphics outputs happen)
* ProvideConsoleGop: YES (Enables GOP, AptioMemoryFix currently offers this but will soon be removed)
* ReleaseUsbOwnership: NO (Releases USB controller from firmware driver)
* RequestBootVarRouting: NO (Redirects AptioMemeoryFix from EFI_GLOBAL_VARIABLE_G to OC_VENDOR_VARIABLE_GUID. Needed for when firmware tries to delete boot entries)
* SanitiseClearScreen: NO (Fixes High resolutions displays that display OpenCore in 1024x768)
