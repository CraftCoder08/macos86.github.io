## Who is this guide for

This guide focuses on the process of installing macOS on X86 based PCs, with the aid of a tool called OpenCore. This guide is open to users of all skill level but you must be willing to read, learn and google frequently. This is not a simple 1-click install setup.

Please remember that OpenCore is still new and currently in beta. While quite stable, and arguably much more stable than Clover in pretty much every way, it is still being frequently updated and so chunks of configuration change quite often(ie. New quirks replacing old ones)

Lastly, those having issues can visit both the [r/Hackintosh subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/) and [r/Hackintosh discord](https://discord.gg/u8V7N5C) for more help.
